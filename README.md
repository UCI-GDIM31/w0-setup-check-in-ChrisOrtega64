# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
 
I am Christopher Ortega, but I prefer to go by Chris since it is easier to go by during a conversation. I use he/him pronouns. Some games I play during my free time are Roblox, Minecraft, Apex Legends, and Muse Dash. I enjoy playing Roblox and Minecraft with friends since we try our best to enjoy the weekends by playing a Roblox horror experience or Minecraft when we feel like adding something new to our world as we usually do not have time during the weekdays to play due to conflicting schedules. I also like playing Apex Legends when I feel like experiencing competitive gameplay and want to play a battle royale or First/Third Person Shooter since it helps me relax after a long day. Playing Muse Dash also helps me improve my hand-eye coordination and keeps me focused whenever I feel bored or need a break after writing for so long.

These experiences each inspired me to look deeper into how various individuals come together to create video games, which led me to take courses in game design, such as this one. I also wanted to take these game design courses to learn more about the video game industry and achieve my dream job of becoming a video game developer. Besides this course being a requirement for my GDIM major, I want to get more accustomed to different software utilized in video game development, such as Unity, Visual Studio, Unreal Engine, and various others. I also want to gain more experience in coding and try to develop small games to include in my resume to get a job at a video game company, such as EA, Insomniac Games, or Nintendo. In addition, some experience I have in game development is making games in Unity, such as a 2D Farmer Shooter, a 3D Marble Runner, a 2D Flappy Bird Game, and a 3D Sidescroller Game. However, I want to try learning more about different coding techniques as these projects were created by following directions from a Google Doc and not making the game from scratch/by myself, other than the 3D Marble Runner Game.

Overall, I hope this course will teach me the essentials of using different software, like Unity and Visual Studio, to understand and make simple 2D or 3D games, improve my portfolio, and get a job at a video game company by the time I graduate from UCI.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

During this class, I hope to learn more about using different video game engines and how to program in multiple languages besides C# since it is usually associated with game development. I also want to start making my (own) simple games like the previous ones in my C# Game Design class during my senior year of high school since I never felt accomplished when making these games due to only copying the instructions on a document and reviewing what I learned, specifically understanding what I coded. In addition, I want to learn more about the video game industry, particularly how to network with others in the industry and gain hands-on experience in building game projects with others to improve my resume and coding skills.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

The only two things I am worried about in this course are whether I can keep up with the workload due to other classwork and whether I cannot work with others due to my nervousness around them, such as staying quiet and not communicating with them or working alone since I do not know anyone in the class. I also worry about not coding (flawlessly) since it is a complicated language to understand. Yet, I want to comprehend the language to get a job in the video game industry or something related to coding/development.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

I studied and wrote code in the C# language during high school, specifically in my C# Game Design in my senior year. During this high school class, I practiced making small games by following the instructor's directions on a Google Doc, such as a 2D Flappy Bird remake, a 3D Marble Runner game, and a 2D Farmer Shooter. As a class, we would continuously progress each week on making a game in Unity and try to make it unique, such as spending around three weeks in the 3D Marble Runner game by including different obstacles and routes depending on how we wanted to develop it.

2. Game development (any engine)

I have had less than or equivalent to half a year of experience as a (video game) programmer since I utilized Visual Studio to make games within the Unity game engine.

3. Unity

I have minimal experience in the Unity game engine and want to continue my passion for making video games by using it more throughout this quarter.

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

N/A

2. Scope management

N/A

3. Iteration

I remember using the Iteration variable in past projects but need a refresher. From what I can remember, it is utilized (mainly) for loops. I remember it was formatted like this: 

[ 

for(counter; condition; iterator) 
{
// Code runs here
}

]

[ 

counter = int i=0 (starts at 0 loops)

condition = i < 5 (ends after 5 loops, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] )

iterator = i+=1 (adds by 1 for each loop)

]

4. Object-Oriented programming

N/A

5. Model-View-Controller architecture

N/A
