This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
 
Hello my name is Christopher Ortega. I use he/him pronouns and my prefered name is Chris since it is shorter.

    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

I have studied and written code in the C# language during highschool, specifically in my C# Game Design in my senior year. During this course, I practiced making small games by following the instructor's directions on a Google Doc, such as a Flappy Bird remake, a 3D Marble Runner game, and a 2D Farmer Shooter. As a class, we would continously progress each week on making a game in Unity and try to make it unique, such as the 3D Marble Runner game having different obstacles and routes depending on the developer.

2. Game development (any engine)

I have only a bit of expereince in using Visual Studio to make games within the Unity Engine.

3. Unity

I have minimal expereience in the Unity Engine and want to continue my passion for making video games.

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
